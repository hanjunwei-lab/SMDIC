\usage{
exp2cell(
  exp,
  method = "xCell",
  perm = 100,
  QN = TRUE,
  kcdf = c("Gaussian", "Poisson", "none")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{The gene expression data set. A matrix with row names as symbols and columns as samples.
Gene expression profiles were used to quantify cell abundance matrix.}

\item{method}{Method must be one of "xCell", "ssGSEA" and "CIBERSORT".}

\item{perm}{No. permutations; set to >=100 to calculate p-values (default = 100)}

\item{QN}{Quantile normalization of input mixture (default = TRUE)}

\item{kcdf}{By default, kcdf="Gaussian" which is suitable when input expression values are continuous,
such as microarray fluorescent units in logarithmic scale, RNA-seq log-CPMs, log-RPKMs or log-TPMs.
When input expression values are integer counts, such as those derived from RNA-seq experiments,
then this argument should be set to kcdf="Poisson".}
}
\value{
Cell abundance matrix.
}
\description{
Function `exp2cell` use gene expression profiles to quantify cell abundance matrix.
`exp2cell` provides three methods for estimating the relative infiltration abundance of different cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME),
which including xCell, ssGSEA estimated method proposed by Şenbabaoğlu et al. and CIBERSORT.
}
\examples{
#get breast cancer gene expression profile.
exp.example<-GetExampleData("exp.example")

#perform the exp2cell method. Method must be one of "xCell","ssGSEA" and "CIBERSORT".
cellmatrix<-exp2cell(exp=exp.example,method="ssGSEA") #cell abundance matrix
